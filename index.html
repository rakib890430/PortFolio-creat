            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>If you want to become a web developer you maybe are thinking of becoming <br>a full-stack developer,and
                the
                first step to do that is learning how to become<br> a good front-end developer,and that means, you have
                to
                learn first HTML, CSS,<br> and JS, but we will leave JS for another interesting article.</p>

                <p>Things happen in life that we may not be able to explain at times,<br> but in hindsight we have been
                    able
                    to
                    keep the pieces to pieces and understand everything, albeit a little. This is my journey to
                    become a
                    developer.

                    I realize the paths<br> I'm following now but these weren't exactly things I had planned in<br> the
                    beginning.
                    But these small steps of mine I believe can help those who<br> want to start this path. I would like
                    to
                    share based on my personal experience, I believe that anyone who wants to be a developer can move
                    forward.</p>

                <p>My start was not very easy and it was not very difficult. The first is that you need<br> to have a
                    clear
                    and
                    ambitious reason why you want to be a web developer.<br> This can be quite subjective, so not
                    everyone
                    has
                    to agree with my idea, but make<br> sure your reasons are enough to keep you going. But some of the
                    reasons
                    I'm so <br>discouraged are "I want to be a developer to make money" or "I want to be a developer
                    <br>to
                    create
                    applications." Aren't all developers working for this reason? Well, most successful<br>developers
                    have
                    all
                    of these factors not just as their main focus, but as the output of what they have done.
                    After thinking a lot, I somehow decided that I would be a web developer and I am slowly going down
                    that
                    path.
                    I wish blessings to all.
